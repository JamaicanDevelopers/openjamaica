## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jordanliu/openjamaica/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/jordanliu/openjamaica/issues); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
